## Roadside Vegetation Control
Controlling roadside vegetation is an important part of infrastructure maintenance. While the plants can perform important functions such as noise and erosion control, out-of-control vegetation can reduce visibility, obscure signage, and even damage road surfaces [@Milton.HandbookRoadEcology.2015; @Johnson.BestPracticesHandbook.2008]. For these reasons, keeping roadside vegetation trimmed to a reasonable level throughout the right-of-way is required for the safety and longevity of a road system.

Many technologies can be used to manage roadside vegetation. Options include mowing, herbicides (either conventional chemical herbicides or alternative organic herbicides), mulching, and burning [@Barker.AlternativeManagementRoadside.2009] and even exotic technologies like infrared radiation [@Burnham.NonChemicalMethods.2003]. The most commonly used today are a combination of mowing and spot-application of conventional chemical herbicides [@Herold.IntegratedVegetationManagement.2014; @Nemec.HowEngineersRoadside.2022]. While the other mentioned technologies are occasionally used in specialty applications, the significantly higher cost of materials and labor required render them infeasible for general use [@Barker.AlternativeManagementRoadside.2009].

Given that mechanical mowing is the primary method for controlling roadside vegetation, one must consider several parts of the mowing system in order to study the process effectively. The first and most obvious thing to examine is the machine used for mowing; in Indiana, this is typically a tractor towing a flex-wing mower [@Mathew.LeveragingTelematicsWeather.2018; @Mardikes.AutonomousRoadsideMowing.2023]. The other important part of the mowing process is, of course, the ground to be worked. This paper describes the development of a data collection process for the study of both the agricultural machines performing the work and the terrain and vegetation to be mowed.

## Agricultural Machine Data
Contractors working for the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) typically utilize a mid-size tractor towing a 15-foot wide flex-wing mower in order to mow the right-of-way. A photograph of such a system is shown in @Fig:mower.

These kinds of vehicles almost always have several embedded computer systems that control different aspects of the machine. All are connected via a Controller Area Network (CAN), and communicate on that network with a standardized digital system called ISOBUS [@Brodie.BuzzwordIsobus.2023]. Messages published on this bus can include information such as the engine speed, torque, temperature, and ground speed, as well as information about attached networked implements such as mowers. This information can be recorded during operations in order to collect data about the machine was used.
