  abstract  = {This paper discusses the use of autonomous mowers for application in highway vegetation control. In recent work by these writers, a unique autonomous mower testbed has been developed to prove the efficacy of such an approach. The testbed’s uniqueness comes from its relatively low cost and its new and accurate sensing method. The mowing performance is evaluated based on the consistency of consecutive mowing paths from actual outdoor testing. Then, a hypothetical implementation is used to evaluate the practicality of the system in California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) applications. Results show that autonomous mowers have the potential to significantly reduce Caltrans’ dependence on herbicide, improve worker and public safety, lead to enhanced levels of environmental quality, and decrease the operation’s costs.},

  abstract    = {Maintaining roadsides for safety and aesthetics is an important issue for all levels of government throughout Minnesota. Vegetation is one important element of roadside maintenance. A healthy roadside environment reduces maintenance needs and costs, reduces erosion and improves water quality, improves water infiltration and reduces runoff, preserves the roadside surface, maximizes safety for vehicles and travelers, limits liability for the governing agency, maintains good public relations, improves the overall driving experience, and provides habitat for wildlife populations. This handbook was written to provide guidelines for effective management of roadside vegetation for local agencies, and highlights eight best management practices (BMPs) that were identified through research, literature review, surveys, and discussion with industry experts. The eight best management practices for roadside vegetation are:
                 
                 (1) develop an integrated roadside vegetation management plan,
                 (2) develop a public relations plan,
                 (3) develop a mowing policy and improved procedures,
                 (4) establish sustainable vegetation,
                 (5) control prohibited and restricted noxious weeds,
                 (6) manage living snow fences,
                 (7) use integrated construction and maintenance practices, and
                 (8) manage roadside vegetation for wildlife and vehicle safety.
                 
                 The main conclusion from the handbook is that successful roadside vegetation management depends on an integrated approach. This includes a wide variety of best management practices to address the many issues involved. This integrated approach includes an assessment of the existing conditions and determination of the type of roadside environment desired. Other construction operations, including proper seeding techniques, selection of the correct plant in the right area, selection of salt-tolerant plant species where needed, and erosion control, will greatly affect the roadside condition. Use of integrated construction and maintenance practices is one of the most important best management practices identified in the handbook.},

  abstract  = {Management of vegetation is an important element of roadside maintenance for safety and aesthetics. Current methods of management by highway departments principally involve mowing and the use of conventional, chemical herbicides. This research addressed use of herbicides (citric acid, clove oil, corn gluten meal, and pelargonic acid) that are considered as alternatives to conventional herbicides and the use of mechanical treatments of woodchip and bark mulches and burning. These alternative methods were compared with the use of conventional herbicides to assess the relative efficacy of treatments on roadside sites. A single application of pelargonic acid demonstrated immediate or short-term suppression of growth of vegetation; however, the efficacy lasted for no more than 6 weeks, after which regrowth was not distinguishable from untreated vegetation. Repeated applications of pelargonic acid will be necessary for season-long efficacy. Formulations of citric-acetic acid gave no control or only weak suppression of vegetative growth soon after application, and no suppression was evident after 6 weeks, suggesting that these materials have only limited use in roadside environments. The effects of burning lasted for about 6 weeks. No suppression of growth of roadside vegetation occurred with the use of corn gluten meal, which acted as a nitrogen fertilizer to promote growth. Mulches of bark or woodchips were strongly suppressive against emerging vegetation for 2 years, but were more effective in the first year than in the second year after application. The costs of materials and labor for the alternative practices were substantially more than for the conventional herbicides used in this study.},

  abstract = {Recently the value of roadside vegetation as habitat for pollinators has gained increased attention, particularly in areas dominated by agriculture where there is little native vegetation available. However, many factors, including safety, cost, public perception, erosion control, and weedy plants must be considered when managing roadside vegetation. Although their decisions influence thousands of hectares of public rights-of-way, how engineers and roadside managers maintain roadside vegetation has been the subject of little research. In this study, we surveyed county engineers and roadside managers who manage vegetation along secondary roads in Iowa, USA to assess how they maintain roadside vegetation. Some counties employ roadside managers, who often have an environmental sciences background, to implement the on-the-ground management of roadside vegetation, while some counties use other staff. Compared to engineers, roadside managers more strongly agreed that using the ecological principles of integrated roadside vegetation management (IRVM) provided environmental benefits. Engineers in counties with a roadside manager more strongly agreed that IRVM practices reduce the spread of invasive species and provide attractive roadsides. Both engineers and roadside managers mentioned challenges to managing roadside vegetation, including interference with some native plantings by adjacent landowners, and ranked safety and soil erosion concerns as the highest priorities when making decisions. Four in ten roadside managers said their counties had protected native plant community remnants on secondary roadsides. Our findings can inform conservation outreach efforts to those responsible for managing roadside vegetation, and emphasize the importance of addressing safety and soil erosion concerns in roadside research and communications.},

  abstract    = {With over 90,000 miles of road in Indiana, it is important that adjoining vegetation be maintained for safety concerns, road structure maintenance and aesthetics. Mowing is currently the main form of vegetation management on INDOT (Indiana Department of Transportation) roadside. Ever-increasing fuel costs and the high labor demand associated with mowing leads to millions of dollars spent on in-house and contract mowing cycles each year. Drastic cost reductions can be achieved by reducing mowing cycles through the incorporation of other management tools including herbicide and native plantings. This study provides data on six herbicide tank mixtures (Milestone/Escort; Milestone/Escort/Plateau; Perspective; Perspective/Plateau; Viewpoint/Streamline; and 2,4-D/Escort/Plateau) and two mowing cycles (one-cycle and two-cycle) at six sites across the state. All herbicide treatments decreased broadleaf cover better than mowing treatments. Herbicide treatments containing Plateau, a plant growth regulator that retards cool-season grass growth, had the shortest grass height. Herbicide mixtures without Plateau were still shorter than mowing plots due to the seedhead suppression qualities found in the selective broadleaf herbicides. A cost savings of over 40% is achieved with one application of herbicide in lieu of one cycle of mowing. Further cost savings can be achieved through the planting of native vegetation, which was the focus of the second portion of this project. Four native seed mixes (western wheat, short grass, tall grass and short grass with forbs) were analyzed for use on right-of-ways. Successful native plantings have reduced maintenance costs for many DOTs across the country by eliminating mowing and herbicide needs. Drought and persistent weeds at study sites resulted in a sparse covering of native species during the year after planting. This is not uncommon for native roadside planting studies since many native grass species require two to three growing seasons to establish.},

  abstract    = {The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) is responsible for the construction and maintenance of approximately 11,000 centerline miles of state roads, US routes and interstates. Mowing operations along the state rights-of-way to manage vegetation consume considerable resources. Mowing activities are usually reported by daily work orders and it is difficult to obtain quantitative information characterizing the utilization and productivity of the mowing operations.
                 
                 This research uses telematics data from commercial sensors to track the daily activity of seven mowers in the Fort Wayne district. Weather data from NOAA was also captured to estimate the weather related delays. During a one-month period, the mowers collectively covered a total of around 1170 miles and an area of nearly 1800 acres of mowing. Crews worked alternative work schedules with extended hours four days a week. On an average 9.5-hour workday approximately 50% of the time is spent actively mowing. The simple telematics based metrics and visualization graphics proposed in this paper can be used by agencies to evaluate the efficiency of their mowing operations to provide guidance on resource allocation, scheduling, and comparison with alternative contract agencies as they provide a concise way of communicating to stakeholders the overall efficiency of the mowing. The proposed utilization graphics may be of particular interest to operations and can be used to identify opportunities for efficiency improvements.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we study deep learning approaches for monocular visual odometry (VO). Deep learning solutions have shown to be effective in VO applications, replacing the need for highly engineered steps, such as feature extraction and outlier rejection in a traditional pipeline. We propose a new architecture combining ego-motion estimation and sequence-based learning using deep neural networks. We estimate camera motion from optical flow using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and model the motion dynamics using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The network outputs the relative 6-DOF camera poses for a sequence, and implicitly learns the absolute scale without the need for camera intrinsics. The entire trajectory is then integrated without any post-calibration. We evaluate the proposed method on the KITTI dataset and compare it with traditional and other deep learning approaches in the literature.},

  abstract = {Introduction
Roadside vegetation provides numerous environmental and psychological benefits to drivers. Previous studies have shown that natural landscapes can effectively lower crash rates and cause less frustration and stress to the driver. However, run-off-the-road crashes resulting in a collision with a tree are twice as likely to result in a fatality, reinforcing the need to examine the placement of vegetation within the clear zone.
Method
This study explores the relationship between the size of the clear zone and the presence of roadside vegetation on vehicle speed and lateral position. A static evaluation, distributed electronically to 100 licensed drivers, was utilized to gather speed selections for both real and virtual roads containing four combinations of clear zone sizes and roadside vegetation densities. A case study was included in the static evaluation to investigate the presence of utility poles near the edge of the road on speed selection. Validation of the static evaluation was performed by a field data collection on the same roadways shown to participants in the evaluation.
Results
The speeds observed in the field for roadways with medium clear zone/dense vegetation or large clear zone/spare vegetation correlated with the speeds chosen by static evaluation participants. Further field data were obtained on vehicle speeds and lateral positions for additional roads demonstrating the same clear zone size/vegetation density combinations.
Practical application
This study successfully demonstrates the relationship between clear zone design and driver behavior, which could improve clear zone design practices and thus roadway safety.},

Native prairie wildflower seed quality was found to be highly variable among supply companies, species, and years. Less variability was found among “garden” wildflower species and suppliers. Direct seeding was found to be successful with six species of native prairie forbs: Butterfly Milkweed Asclepiads tuberose, Wild Bergamot Monarda fistulosa, New England Aster Aster novae-angliae, Pale-purple Coneflower Echinacea pallida, Gray-headed Coneflower Ratibido pinnota, Ironweed Vernonia fasciculosa. Five species of “garden” wildflowers performed well: Common Cosmos Cosmos bipinnatus, Yellow Cosmos Cosmos sulphureus, Cornflower Centaurea cyanus, Goldenwave Coreopsis sincioria, Black-eyed Susan Rudbeckia hiria. Significant variation was found for species establishment success with respect to soil type. Seeding transplanting was found to be a successful method for establishment of forb species, especially those that are difficult to establish by direct seeding. Eight-inch deep seeding tubes increased plant survival compared to plants produced in five inch deep tubes. Use of water-holding polymers in the growing medium, or inoculation with vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi did not improve forb transplant survival. YAM inoculation did result in larger plants after the first growing season. The cost of establishment and management of wildflowers varied with the type and management strategy. Wildflowers were found to be cost-effective when compared to the current grass monoculture vegetation strategy used by INDOT. “Garden” wildflowers were more costly initially, but became cost effective when low, long-term management costs were factored into the analysis.},

  abstract   = {Road construction has produced a large number of exposed slopes, and herbaceous plants restoration has become the mainstream way of roadside slope ecological restoration. However, information regarding how the erosion processes and control efficiency on roadside slop differ as functions of herbaceous plants densities and components is lacking. The Bothriochloa ischcemum (Linn.). Keng (BI) and the  Artemisia vestita Wall. ex Bess (AG) were planted to investigate the effect of aboveground part, BSCs and plant root system on runoff and sediment yield under different planting densities. In total, 24 steel tanks were planted, and two tanks were used as bare soil controls. The artificial simulated rainfalls (60 mm h-1) were conducted on a 15° slope, and the runoff generation and sediment yield were measured. The results showed that the herbaceous plants would effectively reduce the runoff and sediment yield by 4.47\% to 60.89\%, 64.47\% to 93.31\% for BI, and 2.90\% to 45.05\%, 63.95\% to 90.05\% for AG, respectively. The contributions on runoff and sediment yield were increased with increasing of planting densities as power functions both BI and AG. When the planting density was 25 plant m-2 , the reduction of sediment yield slightly increases. Generally, the high contribution on runoff was found in aboveground, and it was 1.05 to 2.54 times than that of BSCs and plant root system. However, the high value contribution on sediment yield was found in plant root system, and it was 4.73 and 12.62, 37.19 and 1.80 times than that of aboveground part and BSCs in BI and AG, respectively. In total, the contribution on runoff and sediment yield of BI were 1.52 and 1.01 times than that of AG. Finally, in roadside slop protection process, we recommend planting a density of 25 plant m-2 herbaceous plants with stolon and a fibrous root system.},

  abstract  = {In semiarid Mediterranean areas, the widespread environmental impact caused by the construction of motorways, railways, and pipelines has created an increasing need for effective restoration. We examined the influence of slope characteristics on vegetation and water erosion on 71 motorway slopes in a semiarid Mediterranean region. Specifically, we studied the effect of slope angle, type (roadfill vs. roadcut) and aspect (north vs. south) on soil properties, vegetation cover, species richness, floristic composition, and water-caused erosion. Temporal dynamics of soil water content was monitored and related to the soil water potential in order to explain possible differences in vegetation cover between slope types. The main factors influencing vegetation on motorway slopes were the angle, type, and aspect of the slope. Vegetation was almost completely lacking on roadcuts with slopes greater than 45°. On gentler slopes, vegetation cover was 44–78\% on roadfills but did not reach 10\% on roadcuts, regardless of aspect. The main soil properties affected by the slope type and aspect were the organic matter content, soil available P, and water content. Rill erosion, gully erosion, and mass movement were all significantly higher on roadcuts than roadfills. A total of 308 spontaneous colonizers and seeded species were recorded. The type and aspect of the slope also controlled species composition. The short duration of available water in the soil with respect to soil water potential proved to be a limiting factor to plant colonization on roadcuts and south-facing slopes as well as the low soil fertility in the case of roadcuts. Our results underscore the difficulty of revegetating slopes with angles greater than 45°, where the probability of seeds moving downhill is high. Future efforts should focus on increasing the surface roughness or building terraces at regular intervals in order to reduce slope angle to less than 45° and favor seed trapping and germination. On gentler slopes, adjusting of seed mixes according to dominant species associated with each slope type and aspect should improve considerably the success of roadside revegetation.},

  abstract  = {Many studies focus on the effects of vegetation cover on water erosion rates, whereas little attention has been paid to the effects of the below ground biomass. Recent research indicates that roots can reduce concentrated flow erosion rates significantly. In order to predict this root effect more accurately, this experimental study aims at gaining more insight into the importance of root architecture, soil and flow characteristics to the erosion-reducing potential of roots during concentrated flow. Treatments were (1) bare, (2) grass (representing a fine-branched root system), (3) carrots (representing a tap root system) and (4) carrots and fine-branched weeds (representing both tap and fine-branched roots). The soil types tested were a sandy loam and a silt loam. For each treatment, root density, root length density and mean root diameter (D) were assessed. Relative soil detachment rates and mean bottom flow shear stress were calculated. The results indicate that tap roots reduce the erosion rates to a lesser extent compared with fine-branched roots. Different relationships linking relative soil detachment rate with root density could be established for different root diameter classes. Carrots with very fine roots (D {\textless} 5 mm) show a similar negative exponential relationship between root density and relative soil detachment rate to grass roots. With increasing root diameter (5 {\textless} D {\textless} 15 mm) the erosion-reducing effect of carrot type roots becomes less pronounced. Additionally, an equation estimating the erosion-reducing potential of root systems containing both tap roots and fine-branched roots could be established. Moreover, the erosion-reducing potential of grass roots is less pronounced for a sandy loam soil compared with a silt loam soil and a larger erosion-reducing potential for both grass and carrot roots was found for initially wet soils. For carrots grown on a sandy loam soil, the erosion-reducing effect of roots decreases with increasing flow shear stress. For grasses, grown on both soil types, no significant differences could be found according to flow shear stress. The erosion-reducing effect of roots during concentrated flow is much more pronounced than suggested in previous studies dealing with interrill and rill erosion. Root density and root diameter explain the observed erosion rates during concentrated flow well for the different soil types tested. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The paper treats in depth the expected attenuation of automobile and particularly diesel tractor-trailer generated hoise by the interposition of extensive and dense planting of trees and shrubs between the highway and the community. The results of research, by the author and others cited in the paper, gives clear indication that a belt of dense man-made growth of tall trees and underbrush can give as much as 5 to 8 dB truck/car noise reduction per 100 ft of planting depth. Natural growth of deep forests were measured to give from 3 to 5 dB attenuation per 100 ft of planting depth. Planting depth of at least 100 ft is required to give reliable results, with tree heights of 40-50 ft desirable and densities of 50-70 ft visibility needed for good effect. The paper provides considerable experimental verification by an analysis of the current literature. The types of noise sources in cars and trucks are briefly treated as are community reactions to noise from such sources. The dBA is used as the accepted measure for characterizing truck and automobile noise. Both spherical and cylindrical radiation of sound are discussed for low density and high density traffic, respectively. The paper concludes with an example of attenuation of a typical truck noise by spherical and cylindrical radiation for low- and high-density traffic and a 200-ft deep planting of dense, mature forest. It is concluded that a mature belt of either coniferous or deciduous forest with underbrush can produce barely acceptable noise levels in the community which is separated by such a noise barrier from a heavily traveled highway.},

  abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an important air pollutant due to its adverse health effects. Vehicle emissions make a large contribution to particle concentrations in urban areas. Exposure to particles especially near roadways increases the risk of public health problems. Planting vegetation might be used to capture the fine particles at the roadside, which can lower the health risks for the urban population. Istanbul is the most populous city in Turkey, where the number of non-electric cars is increasing rapidly, resulting in decreasing air quality, especially at the roadsides. Recent studies show that cardiovascular, respiratory and total non-accidental mortality is increasing with short-term exposure to outdoor air pollution in Istanbul. In this study, roadside trees were investigated for the mitigation effect on vehicle-related PM2.5 and heavy metal (HM). Cupressus sempervirens (Mediterranean Cypress trees) were planted in three different cases (i.e., no trees-C1, trees with gaps-C2 and thick trees with no gaps-C3) at the study site. Location of the site is on a dense-traffic roadside in Istanbul, where thousands of people are living, working and walking through two sides of this road. PM2.5 samples and tree leaves were examined in the performed experiments. C2 and C3 showed the importance of roadside tree plantation by reducing the exposure to significantly low levels. Roadside PM2.5 concentrations were reduced by 17\% in C3, equivalent to urban background levels in the city. Maximum removal of HMs is observed in nickel from 26.4 ± 7.8 to 7.5 ± 2.4 μg m−3. Pedestrian exposure is calculated with the measured data in three experiments and exposure is significantly reduced (e.g., {\textgreater}50\% for cadmium and lead exposure) in experiment C3. In conclusion, three experiments showed that Mediterranean Cypress trees significantly decreased particle pollution at roadsides in Istanbul.},

To restore and preserve diverse and native roadside vegetation, we suggest (1) facilitating discussion, cooperation, and knowledge transfer between ecologists and agencies responsible for roadside vegetation management, (2) prioritizing the use of native plant species in roadside restoration and revegetation, as well as increasing regional capacities for native seed production, (3) supporting the application of biodiversity-friendly management practices of roadside vegetation, and (4) inventorying and conserving remnant semi-natural roadside grasslands.},

Incorporating extensive geospatial data, the RVET covers five major aspects: environmental benefits, operational and maintenance measures, lifecycle costs, public perception of roads and vegetation, and public perception of aesthetics. The RVET will assist the statewide implementation of improved roadside vegetation management within the TxDOT system, enhancing the health and safety of Texans. This study delivers a comprehensive evaluation of roadside vegetation, providing valuable insights for stakeholders through detailed measurements across five major modules.},

These arthropod-mediated ecosystem services (AMES) include crop pollination and pest control, which help to maintain agricultural productivity and reduce the need for pesticide inputs. Maximizing survival and reproduction of beneficial arthropods requires provision of pollen and nectar resources that are often scarce in modern agricultural landscapes. Increasingly, native plants are being evaluated for this purpose. Native plants can outperform recommended non-natives and also provide local adaptation, habitat permanency, and support of native biodiversity. We predict that the success of insect conservation programs using flowering plants to increase AMES on farmland will depend on landscape context, with the greatest success in landscapes of moderate complexity. Reintegration of native plants into agricultural landscapes has the potential to support multiple conservation goals, and will require the collaboration of researchers, conservation educators, and native plant experts.},

The research objectives were to investigate: (1) the successional process of roadside grasses using TxDOT’s seed mix and seeding procedure on field laboratory test plots and actual roadsides, (2) erosion control properties of vegetation on 12 new plots seeded with TxDOT’s standard seed mix and 10 existing plots originally seeded with a non-TxDOT seed mix, and (3) the impacts of mowing on establishing and established grass communities. To achieve these objectives, the researchers conducted field laboratory experiments and actual highway roadside surveys. The results indicate that roadsides as maintained and mowed environments cannot be easily adapted by tall grass species (native or introduced). Short, sod-forming grasses, however, could grow better on roadsides. It was found that grass species in TxDOT's standard seed mixes did not show invasiveness on investigated laboratory plots and actual roadsides. The researchers also found little connection between original seeded grass species and observed grass species several years after seeding. This implies that volunteer species either from adjacent lands or from seed banks in the soil tend to dominate roadsides in the long term. All field laboratory plots controlled erosion very well. Yielded sediments were much below the TxDOT’s minimum performance standards. Little literature was found on cost and benefit analysis about roadside management as a result of a lack of consistent cost database data held by state DOTs, which suggests future research on creating a database for comparing cost-benefit between the uses of natives and introduced grasses.},

The frame houses a motor controller, two drive motors with encoders, a GPS, a PC, and several batteries. Accurate path tracking is achieved by the fusion of encoder data with GPS data by the utilization of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The purpose of this thesis will be to document the process of optimizing and adding further functionality to the existing Autonomower design. It was of particular importance to remedy the Autonomower's inability to detect and avoid obstacles. To perform this task, various types of sensors were evaluated for their ability to interpret obstacle information. Ultimately, a SICK LMS291 LIDAR sensor was selected for integration. The transition from a fixed path to an obstacle driven path warranted the evaluation of several different types of path tracking algorithms. Additionally, a robust and efficient algorithm was needed to interpret the LIDAR sensor data. Path tracking and obstacle avoidance algorithms were evaluated using a series of both qualitative and quantitative measures. These algorithms were tested in the context of a mowing operation based on a preplanned path. The testing resulted in the final selection and implementation of a pure-pursuit based reactive obstacle avoidance algorithm. Final testing was conducted to confirm the successful integration of the algorithm into the Autonomower software.},

  abstract = {California is a state of diverse landscapes and an ever developing population. The citizens of California depend heavily on the state's vast highway system for transportation. As one could imagine, maintenance of this highway system is a very difficult task. Specifically, vegetation control along the roadside poses a very challenging problem. It also creates a safety hazard to those that are assigned with the task of maintaining it. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) is the chief organization responsible for roadway maintenance. Caltrans has demonstrated interest in discovering new ways to improve their current methods of vegetation control. These new methods would promote roadside worker and public safety, help decrease the amount of herbicide application, increase process efficiency, and reduce costs. The Advance Highway Maintenance and Construction Technology (AHMCT) Research Center has been assisting Caltrans with the study needed to expand upon new methods of vegetation control. There are numerous possibilities that have been considered for further research and development including but not limited to hot foam or steam application, the use infrared heat, hydraulic obliteration and vegetation cutting attachments for the Automated Roadside Debris Vacuum (ARDVAC). Most recently, AHMCT has conducted research for Caltrans to further develop the concept and implementation of an automated roadside mowing system. The ultimate goal of the system would be to have a fleet of autonomous mowing robots. The fleet could be deployed on the roadside at certain intervals where they would commence mowing of the roadside. All the while the robots would need minimal interaction from a Caltrans worker, as they would be completely autonomous. After the sections of roadside, to be mowed, were completed the robots could be recovered. A robotic test platform was designed and constructed based on the concept of a GPS guided, autonomous mower also known as, "Autonomower". A control system to guide the robot on a back and forth, "strip fill" type pattern was also designed and implemented in software. The control system was tested as to the accuracy at which it could maneuver the platform along this path across an area that was input by a user. The purpose of this platform, in terms of research, was to provide the tools necessary to develop additional support systems that would be required for an autonomous roadside machine of any kind. The purpose of this thesis will be to take a look at one such support system, object detection and avoidance. First, a complete understanding of the typical roadside environment that may be encountered by the robot is necessary. The environment will have some effect on what sensors and algorithm are finally selected. The hardware and software elements required to perform the task of obstacle detection and avoidance will need to be determined. A literature review will be conducted for object detection and avoidance algorithms that have been used in previous research projects. Not all obstacle avoidance algorithms are created equal, so each algorithm will be evaluated to determine its perceived effectiveness for an autonomous roadside mowing application. A thorough search of object detection sensors will also be conducted. The goal of this search will be to determine what sensor or combination of sensors would allow for the most accurate and repeatable detection of obstacles. A single sensor type will be selected for initial testing and data quantification. Next, as recommended from previous research, the radio control feature will be implemented on the robot. This feature could pose some useful functional possibilities such as easy robot deployment and retrieval, mowing boundary teaching, and remote emergency stop. Finally, conclusions and future research considerations will be addressed.},

The enclosed area must be a continuous area without obstacles of any kind, e.g. trees, lakes or the like.

  abstract   = {Designing highly usable and ergonomic dashboards is fundamental to support users in managing and properly setting complex vehicles, like trains, airplanes, trucks and tractors. Contrarily, control dashboards are usually intrusive, full of controls and not really intuitive or usable. This paper focuses on the design of ergonomic and usable dashboard for specific classes of vehicles, like tractors and trucks. Indeed, trucks and tractors are both vehicles and operating machines, and their control is particularly complex. Indeed, the driver contemporary drives and checks if the machine is working properly. The paper proposes an innovative methodology to design highly usable and compact dashboards inspired by human-centered design and ergonomics principles. The study started by shifting the attention from the machine performance, that is the conventional engineering approach, to the human-system interaction quality, according to a new, transdisciplinary approach. The methodology proposes to combine virtual simulations with human performance analysis to support the design at different stages, from concept generation to detailed design, until testing with users. The methodology uses virtual environments to create digital twins of both driver and controls, making users interact with virtual items and predict the type and nature of interaction. Within virtual scenarios, different configurations of dashboard controls can be easily compared and tested, checking the frequency of use of each control and measuring the achieved human performance related to postural comfort and mental workload. The study adopted the proposed methodology to two industrial use cases focusing on the design of ergonomic dashboards: the former is referred to tractor dashboard and armrest, the latter refers to truck dashboard and seat. Both cases demonstrated that the new methodology allowed improved comfort, higher usability, higher visibility and accessibility, better performance and reduced time for machine control. The study demonstrates how a multidisciplinary user information integration can drive design optimization.},

The survey follows 12 years after an earlier initial survey reported by Dempsey et al. (2005). Approximately 1221 eligible participants were invited by e-mail to participate, and 405 surveys were included in the final analysis. The survey queried use of basic instruments relevant to ergonomic practice as well as more specific analytical tools such as observational techniques for assessing postural demands of work and instrumentation for direct measurement of such demands. Some ergonomic assessment methods appear to have increased in their overall use by U.S. ergonomists compared to 2005 data. This was observed for: RULA, REBA, Psychophysical Upper Extremity Data, Strain Index, and ACGIH TLV for Hand Activity Level. There is minimal evidence of increased overall use of direct measurement approaches in the U.S. There appear to be geographic differences between countries/continents in terms of use of various methods. The use of mobile device/smart phone “apps” by ergonomists was queried and these technologies presently appear to be in early adoption phase with 24–28\% of practitioners reporting use of an app in their ergonomics practice.},

On-going progresses in miniaturised wearable sensors are set to revolutionise biomechanical analysis by providing accurate and real-time quantitative motion data. The construction industry has a poor record of occupational health, in particular with regard to work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). In this article, we therefore focus on the study of human body motions that could cause WMSDs in construction-related activities. We first present an in-depth review of existing assessment frameworks used in practice for the evaluation of human body motion. Subsequently different methods for measuring working postures and motions are reviewed and compared, pointing out the technological developments, limitations and gaps; Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are particularly investigated. Finally, we introduce a new system to detect and characterise unsafe postures of construction workers based on the measurement of motion data from wearable wireless IMUs integrated in a body area network.

  abstract  = {Aiming to address the problems of difficulty in monitoring tractor-mounted agricultural implements in complex field environments and the excessive amount of model parameters, a lightweight RepViT-based agricultural implements recognition model, tractor-mounted agricultural implements net (TMAInet ), was proposed. Firstly, the self-developed agricultural machinery service platform ‘Agricultural Mechanisation Precision Operation Platform’ was used to collect the datasets of agricultural implements in six working states, and the training set was expanded to 6 627 frames by data enhancement methods such as copy-paste. Secondly, based on the RepVIT network model framework, a convolutional feed-forward module ( CFF) was designed to improve the ability of fine-grained feature extraction at different scales, and an attention mechanism, ECA, was introduced to optimize the model parameter structure and simplify the feature extraction module. Finally, the model was trained by pre-training + fine-tuning (PF) migration learning method and deployed on Jetson nano edge devices. The experimental results showed that the recognition accuracy, F1 score and recall of the TMAInet model reached 99.13\% , 98.53 and 98.78\% , respectively, by the PF migration learning method. Compared with the original RepVIT model, the recognition accuracy, F1 score and recall were improved by 1.86 percentage points, 3.04 percentage points and 1.95 percentage points, respectively, and the number of parameters was reduced to 7.3 × 10 6 while maintaining 73 f / s at the edge device side. TMAInet was able to accurately and efficiently monitor the common categories of agricultural implements in practical applications, and it can provide a technical reference for the development of unmanned smart farms. Keywords: tractor-mounted agricultural implements, condition recognition, unmanned smart farms, RepVIT, transfer learning},

  abstract = {In this study, an automatic rescue system was proposed to monitor agricultural machinery operators using machine vision. The rescue system was developed to recognise the driver inattention status, that is, the distraction and fatigue by recognising the driver's actions. A Kinect sensor was used to collect image sequences of the operators, and the recognition system relied on the “player extraction” function of the Kinect sensor. A Hankel-based Kernel Mutual Subspace Method (KMSM) was developed to monitor tractor drivers and recognise driver inattention behaviours. To reduce the computational complexity for fulfilling the requirements of recognition, low-dimensional image vectors were used to generate low-dimensional block Hankel matrixes as representations for input action sequences. To evaluate the performance of the proposed KMSM, a driver action dataset was established that included 10 tractor drivers and 5 types of action that denote inattention. The drivers' inattention actions were classified into three danger levels, and the corresponding countermeasures for the actions at each danger level were similarly classified. Both offline and online experiments using similar subjects and different subjects were conducted to evaluate the designed inattention action recognition algorithm. In the offline experiment, the proposed Hankel-based KMSM achieved recognition rates of 91.18\% and 86.18\% when using similar and different subjects, respectively; and in the online experiment, the proposed method achieved 87.02 and 79.97\% when using similar and different subjects, respectively. The average computation time of the Hankel-based KMSM was 0.07 s in the online experiment. Thus, the proposed Hankel-based KMSM method satisfies both the accuracy and the real-time requirements for a driver rescue system.},

  abstract  = {There is an increasing demand for remote monitoring and management of agricultural machinery operation in conservation tillage. Considering the problems of large errors in detecting operation quality parameters, such as tillage depth and corn straw cover rate, in complex farmland environments, this paper proposes a tillage depth measurement method based on the dual attitude compound of a tractor body and three-point hitch mechanism with lower pull rod and an online measurement method based on K-means clustering of the corn straw cover rate on farmland surface. An operation monitoring terminal was developed for the remote collection of quality parameters of conservation tillage field operation. A remote monitoring system of agricultural machinery operation was constructed and applied over a large area. The field tests showed that the static mean error and root-mean-square error of this method were 0.16 and 0.67 cm for uphill and 0.36 and 0.57 cm for downhill, respectively. For the 28 and 33 cm tillage depth tests, the mean dynamic measurement errors of this method were 0.55 and 0.61 cm, and the root means square errors were 0.64 and 0.73 cm, respectively, and the coefficient of variation of tillage depth did not exceed 3\%. The correlation coefficient between the corn straw cover rate detection algorithm based on K-means clustering and the manual image marking method reached 0.92, with an average error of 9.69\%, and the accuracy filled the demand for straw cover rate detection. The detection accuracy of tillage depth and straw cover rate was high and thus provides an effective means of information technology support for the quality monitoring and production management of conservation tillage farming operations.},

  abstract   = {Vehicle crash rates caused by distracted driving have been rising in recent years. Hence, safety while driving on roads is today a crucial concern across the world. Some of the reasons due to which drivers may lose attention include the use of mobile phones, speaking with passengers, and reaching behind to grab something while driving. There are various types of distractions, out of which we focus on manual ones based on the posture of the driver. This work presents a review on open problems and challenges concerning the vision-based distraction recognition of drivers. Types of experimental environments are described; and image modalities, public and custom datasets and body parts inspected during distraction recognition are explored. Besides, a comparative review of different works on vision-based recognition of driver's manual distractions and limitations for each dataset is presented. Main approaches of vision-based manual distractive driving recognition can be categorized into conventional and deep learning methods. These approaches are compared and classified based on whether using temporal information or not. Finally, we give some suggestions for improvement, and look forward to future development directions of the vision-based recognition of driver's manual distractions.},
